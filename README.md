# Reflection on Project Management Tools:
GitHub helps developers collaborate on coding projects using several project management tools—like milestones, issues, and project boards—that make organizing and completing tasks easier, even for beginners.

### Milestones
GitHub allow teams to group related tasks and set deadlines for them. For example, if you’re building an online shopping site, you can create milestones for designing the homepage, developing the checkout system, and integrating a payment gateway. By breaking the project into smaller goals, milestones help you focus on one task at a time without feeling overwhelmed. This structure is especially helpful for beginners like me, as it clearly shows what needs to be done and by when.

### Issues
Issues are like to-do list items where you can document tasks, bugs, or ideas. Each issue is assigned a title, description, and labels like "bug" or "feature." For beginners like me, this is a great way to contribute to a team project because you can pick an issue that matches your skill level. It’s also easy to discuss solutions or ask for help right inside the issue. This makes GitHub feel like a collaborative workspace where team members share progress and troubleshoot together.

### Project boards
Project boards is more like an other management websites like trelo and jira. It contains visual tools that organize issues into categories like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” I as a beginner often find this especially helpful because it gives a clear picture of what everyone is working on and what still needs attention. You can move tasks across the board as you complete them, which makes progress easy to see and track.

I dont faced any issues while using this project management tools of github. I can say that it is easy to use those tools and it is effective too.
